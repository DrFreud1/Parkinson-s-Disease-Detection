# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection
The present repository contains Matlab and Python code that performs the following tasks on an EEG database in order to classify those signals between Parkinson's disease patients
and healthy controls, those steps are mainly:
  - Signal processing (remove noise and noisy data)
  - Characterization of those EEG signals
  - Feature selection
  - Classification
  
 The final result is a machine learning model capable of distinguishing EEG from PD patients and EEG from healthy people. 
 
 The matlab scripts contain the signal processing steps and the python (jupyter notebook) all the rest.
